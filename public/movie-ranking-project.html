 <h1>The Best Movies According to Sopengu</h1>
 <p>Obviously, this is opinionated. Don't judge me lol.<br />
    Oh, and since I'm a fan of horror movies, I also need to include them.</p>

 <hr />

 <h2>Hell House LLC</h2>
 <p>10/10 movie. Love the raw horror and footage vibes.</p>

 <h2>The Avengers: Endgame</h2>
 <p>Probably the last and best Marvel movie ever made that included everyone (Captain America naur)</p>

 <h2>Spiderman: No Way Home</h2>
 <p>I didn't really watch the whole film, but I really loved it<br />
    because Tobey Maguire, Tom Holland, and Andrew Garfield<br />
    were in the same frickin scene.</p>

<hr />
<p>Anyway, that's it for my TED talk. I also changed the ones from the goal, but<br />
    but it's still technically my movie ranking project lmao.</p>
