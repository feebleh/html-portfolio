            <h2>The Best Movies According to Sopengu</h2>
            <p>Obviously, this is opinionated. Don't judge me lol.<br />
                Oh, and since I'm a fan of horror movies, I also need to include them.</p>

            <hr />

            <h3>Hell House LLC</h3>
            <p>10/10 movie. Love the raw horror and footage vibes.</p>

            <h3>The Avengers: Endgame</h3>
            <p>Probably the last and best Marvel movie ever made that included everyone (Captain America naur)</p>

            <h3>Spiderman: No Way Home</h3>
            <p>I didn't really watch the whole film, but I really loved it<br />
                because Tobey Maguire, Tom Holland, and Andrew Garfield<br />
                were in the same frickin scene.</p>

            <hr />
            <p>Anyway, that's it for my TED talk. I also changed the ones from the goal, but<br />
                but it's still technically my movie ranking project lmao.</p>
